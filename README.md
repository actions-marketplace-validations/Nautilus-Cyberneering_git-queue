This GitHub Action is a job queue with the following characteristics:

- It only allows the execution of one job at a time. Multiple pending jobs are allowed.
- Jobs are done by GitHub workflows intended to create git commits and merge them into target branches.
- It provides an optimistic locking mechanism to guarantee that commits are merged in a mutual exclusion way, avoiding duplicate commits. When the queue accepts more than one active job (not finished) it will also guarantee the execution order.

Formal definition:

> A job queue with concurrency optimistic lock mechanism to guarantee job execution order (by updating the job state), implemented with a event sourcing approach, using empty git commits as the event store. Currently with one pending-to-process job limit.

## Requirements

Since the queue uses empty commits as the queue messages store it requires to be very careful when using some Git commands to re-write the Git history. `git commit --amend` or `git rebase` could alter or destroy the queue integrity.

On the other hand, Git commands that create new commits (rebase, cherry-pick, ...) also generate new commit hashes breaking the links between the queue messages. Queue messages can contain references to other messages using the commit hashes inside the commit message.

## Features

- More than one pending job.
- Log job execution: `start-job`, `finish-job`.
- Custom payload for queue commands.

Check the [Roadmap](https://github.com/Nautilus-Cyberneering/git-queue/issues/6) for upcoming features.

### When to use it

You can use it if:

- You have workflows running in parallel.
- The workflows are going to create new commits in a branch and those commits are going to be merged into another branch.
- And you want to coordinate them to avoid concurrency problems like duplicate commits or commits in the wrong order.

### Why use it

There are other alternatives like [GitHub concurrency groups](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-concurrency), but:

- In some cases, it could be convenient not to couple your application to the GitHub infrastructure.
- Concurrency problems are very tricky to detect and solve. This solution offers a high level of traceability.
- This solution does not require external services, only Git.

### Use case

One comment use case is updating a submodule in a project when the submodule repository is updated.

- You have two Git repositories: `R1` and `R2`.
- `R1` is a submodule of `R2`.
- When a new commit is added to the main branch in `R1` you want to update the submodule in `R2`.
- You have a scheduled workflow `W` in `R2` to import the latest changes from `R1`.

![Sequence diagram](./docs/images/sequence-diagram.svg)

- `T1`. Add a new file to the library (`1.txt`)
- `T2`. We run `W1` to update the library, however, for some reason, this process takes more than 10 minutes.
- `T3`. We modify file `1.txt` in the library.
- `T4`. (T2+10") We run a second workflow `W2` to update the library.
- `T5`. The workflow `W2` finishes and creates a commit with the second version of file `1.txt`.
- `T6`. The workflow `W1` finishes and overwrites the first version of file `1.`txt`.

## Usage

It works on Linux, macOS and Windows [virtual environments](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#supported-virtual-environments-and-hardware-resources).

> IMPORTANT: It has only be tests on Linux. You can contribute [testing it on other operating systems](https://github.com/Nautilus-Cyberneering/git-queue/issues/49).

The action has 3 different commands (specified by the input `action`):

- `create-job`: it allows you to create a new job with any payload.
- `start-job`: it allows the workflow to create a commit when hte job process starts.
- `finish-job`: it allows the workflow to mark the nob as finished.

And one query (also specified by the input `action`):

- `next-job`: it returns the next pending to process job.

You should:

- Create a new Job (`create-job`) and push it immediately to the `main` branch (or whatever your PR target branch is).
- Later, a worker workflow can ask the queue for the next job (`next-job`). The first commit should be the starting commit (`start-job`) and the latest one the finishing commit (`finish-job`).

And the end of the process your `git log` output should be like this:

### Environment variables

If you need to pass environment variables to the `git` child process, you only need to set those variables by using the `env` section of the action:

```yml
- name: Create job
  id: create-job
  uses: Nautilus-Cyberneering/git-queue@v1
  with:
    queue_name: "Library Update - library-aaa"
    action: "create-job"
    job_payload: "job_payload"
  env:
    GNUPGHOME: '~/.gnupg'
    GIT_AUTHOR_NAME: 'A Committer'
    GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL: 'committer@example.com'
    GIT_AUTHOR_DATE: '2005-04-07T22:13:13'
    GIT_COMMITTER_NAME: 'A Committer'
    GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL: 'committer@example.com'
    GIT_COMMITTER_DATE: '2005-04-07T22:13:13'
```
